Pour le dire autrement : la culture propre à l’informatique appara\^{\i}t surtout technique. Mais elle n’est que la traduction contemporaine de l’ensemble des savoir-faire liés à la ma\^{\i}trise de l’écriture. Nous (re)découvrons alors un lien étroit entre culture technique et culture des savants et des érudits, et les anthropologues ont montré la relation entre cette dernière et la culture au sens large : par effet de domination (le pouvoir de l’écrit) et parce que l’écriture invite à la réflexion sur les objets qu’elle manipule ou met en évidence. Il y a donc un lien direct entre culture technique propre \`{a} l’\'{e}criture et culture d’une soci\'{e}t\'{e}. Nous montrons alors comment l’écriture électronique et en réseau infléchit les problématiques et les épistémologies de disciplines communément regroupées sous l’étiquette « sciences humaines et sociales » (SHS) : nouvelles méthodes, potentialités combinatoires, questions posées par les usages du « numérique », etc., mais aussi savoir-faire élémentaires (écrire ou repérer un signe dans un texte). Certaines de ces problématiques commencent \`{a} \^{e}tre abord\'{e}es par des personnes qui se revendiquent du mouvement des « humanités numériques ». Nous montrons que la faiblesse argumentative des repr\'{e}sentants de ce mouvement est moins pr\'{e}occupante pour les scientifiques que la facilit\'{e} avec laquelle ils se font entendre : outre le d\'{e}voilement sociologique du monde universitaire actuel, toujours instructif, ce n’est pas tant l’essor des « humanités numériques » qui pose problème (parce qu’elles seraient mal définies ou joueraient d’un oxymore peu efficace épistémologiquement) que le silence de représentants des « SHS » quant à l’évolution des contours de chacune de leur discipline sous l’effet de l’écriture contemporaine. Pourtant, l’étude de cet effet, déjà balisée par des épistémologues, est prometteuse.

abstract = {KNN and SVM are two machine learning approaches to Text Categorization (TC) based on the Vector Space Model. In this model, borrowed from Information Retrieval, documents are represented as a vector where each component is associated with a particular word from the vocabulary. Traditionally, each component value is assigned using the information retrieval TFIDF measure. While this weighting method seems very appropriate for IR, it is not clear that it is the best choice for TC problems. Actually, this weighting method does not leverage the information implicitly contained in the categorization task to represent documents. In this paper, we introduce a new weighting method based on statistical estimation of the importance of a word for a specific categorization problem. This method also has the benefit to make feature selection implicit, since useless features for the categorization problem considered get a very small weight. Extensive experiments reported in the paper shows that this new weighting method improves significantly the classification accuracy as measured on many categorization tasks. 1},

abstract = {The popularity of microblogging platforms, such as Twitter, renders them valuable real-time information resources for tracking various aspects of worldwide events, e.g., earthquakes, political elections, etc. Such events are usually characterized in microblog posts via the use of hashtags (). As microbloggers come from different backgrounds, and express themselves in different languages, we witness different translations of hashtags which, however, are about the same event. Language-dependent variants of hashtags can possibly lead to issues in content-analysis. In this paper, we propose a method for translating hashtags, which builds on methods from information retrieval. The method introduced is source and target language independent. Our method is desirable, either instead of, or complimentary, to the direct translation of the hashtag for three reasons. First we return a list of hashtags on the same topic, which takes into account the plurality and variability of hashtags used by microbloggers for assigning posts to a topic. Second, our framework accounts for the problem that microbloggers in different languages will refer to the same topic using different tokens. Finally, our method does not require special preprocessing of hashtags, reducing barriers to real-world implementation. We present proof-of-concept results for the given Spanish hashtag 33mineros.},

Lolspeak has influenced other language use and may have a significant impact on the English language, due in part to the internet’s role in the evolution of English (Crystal “Language and the Internet,” 


2006:26-27).  


  To approach this data, I created a multi-modal discourse transcription technique for analyzing 


Lolspeak utterances within the context of their images based on Grounded Theory (Glaser and Strauss “The Discovery of Grounded Theory” 2007:9). I implemented this technique with randomly collected Lolspeak data that I collected from the website www.icanhascheezburger.com. My work has dual future implications in that it could be used to further studies of Lolspeak or other internet dialects/ languages, and the transcription method I have invented could be beneficial to those looking at other forms of

abstract = {The increasing pervasiveness of social media creates new opportunities to study human social behavior, while challenging our capability to analyze their massive data streams. One of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between different kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns versus spontaneous communication. Such detection problems require a formal definition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to person through the social network. Once a meme is identified, supervised learning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication. The appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from existing entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for the novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of social data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content, metadata, network features, and their combinations. We also explore the idea of pre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A systematic evaluation is carried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. Our analysis shows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the best trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that a simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as effective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters. Our approach is fully automatic, unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in streaming data.},

However, representative and reliable statistics on Chinese microbloggers are limited. Using a random sampling approach, this study collected Chinese microblog data from the service provider, analyzing the profile and the pattern of usage for 29,998 microblog accounts. From our analysis, 57.4\% (95\% CI 56.9\%,58.0\%) of the accounts' timelines were empty. Among the 12,774 non-zero statuses samples, 86.9\% (95\% CI 86.2\%,87.4\%) did not make original post in a 7-day study period. By contrast, 0.51\% (95\% CI 0.4\%,0.65\%) wrote twenty or more original posts and 0.45\% (95\% CI 0.35\%,0.60\%) reposted more than 40 unique messages within the 7-day period. A small group of microbloggers created a majority of contents and drew other users' attention. About 4.8\% (95\% CI 4.4\%,5.2\%) of the 12,774 users contributed more than 80\% (95\% CI,78.6\%,80.3\%) of the original posts and about 4.8\% (95\% CI 4.5\%,5.2\%) managed to create posts that were reposted or received comments at least once. Moreover, a regression analysis revealed that volume of followers is a key determinant of creating original microblog posts, reposting messages, being reposted, and receiving comments. Volume of friends is found to be linked only with the number of reposts. Gender differences and regional disparities in using microblogs in China are also observed.},

abstract = {SinaWeibo is a Twitter-like social network service emerging in China in recent years. People can post weibos (microblogs) and communicate with others on it. Based on a dataset of 650 million weibos from August 2009 to January 2012 crawled from APIs of SinaWeibo, we study the hot ones that have been reposted for at least 1000 times. We find that hot weibos can be roughly classified into eight categories, i.e. Entertainment \& Fashion, Hot Social Events, Leisure \& Mood, Life \& Health, Seeking for Help, Sales Promotion, Fengshui \& Fortune and Deleted Weibos. In particular, Leisure \& Mood and Hot Social Events account for almost 65\% of all the hot weibos. This reflects very well the fundamental dual-structure of the current society of China: On the one hand, economy has made a great progress and quite a part of people are now living a relatively prosperous and fairly easy life. On the other hand, there still exist quite a lot of serious social problems, such as government corruptions and environmental pollutions. It is also shown that users' posting and reposting behaviors are greatly affected by their identity factors (gender, verification status, and regional location). For instance, (1) Two thirds of the hot weibos are created by male users. (2) Although verified users account for only 0.1\% in SinaWeibo, 46.5\% of the hot weibos are contributed by them. Very interestingly, 39.2\% are written by SPA users. A more or less pathetic fact is that only 14.4\% of the hot weibos are created by grassroots (individual users that are neither SPA nor verified). (3) Users from different areas of China have distinct posting and reposting behaviors which usually reflect very their local cultures. Homophily is also examined for people's reposting behaviors.},

@book{Butler1993,
abstract = {In Bodies That Matter, Judith Butler further develops her distinctive theory of gender by examining the workings of power at the most "material" dimensions of sex and sexuality. Deepening the inquiries she began in Gender Trouble, Butler offers an original reformulation of the materiality of bodies, examining how the power of heterosexual hegemony forms the "matter" of bodies, sex, and gender. Butler argues that power operates to constrain "sex" from the start, delimiting what counts as a viable sex. Conceived as a regulatory norm, "sex" is appropriated through a citational set of practices. When identifications undercut the heterosexual imperative, abjected beings are produced who become the occasions for a critical rearticulation of heterosexual hegemony. Butler offers a clarification of the notion of "performativity" introduced in Gender Trouble and explores the meaning of a citational politics. The text includes readings of Plato, Irigaray, Lacan, and Freud on the formation of materiality and bodily boundaries; "Paris is Burning," Nella Larsen's "Passing," and short stories by Willa Cather; along with a reconsideration of "performativity" and politics in feminist, queer, and radical democratic theory. Developing more gender trouble across a variety of philosophical, psychoanalytic, and fictional works, Bodies That Matter opens new questions in feminism, poststructuralism, and queer theory.},

abstract = {The wide adoption of social media has increased the competition among ideas for our finite attention. We employ a parsimonious agent-based model to study whether such a competition may affect the popularity of different memes, the diversity of information we are exposed to, and the fading of our collective interests for specific topics. Agents share messages on a social network but can only pay attention to a portion of the information they receive. In the emerging dynamics of information diffusion, a few memes go viral while most do not. The predictions of our model are consistent with empirical data from Twitter, a popular microblogging platform. Surprisingly, we can explain the massive heterogeneity in the popularity and persistence of memes as deriving from a combination of the competition for our limited attention and the structure of the social network, without the need to assume different intrinsic values among ideas.},

abstract = {Microblogging is a communication paradigm in which users post bits of information (brief text updates or micro media such as photos, video or audio clips) that are visible by their communities. When a user finds a “meme” of another user interesting, she can eventually repost it, thus allowing memes to propagate virally trough a social network. In this paper we introduce the meme ranking problem, as the problem of selecting which k memes (among the ones posted their contacts) to show to users when they log into the system. The objective is to maximize the overall activity of the network, that is, the total number of reposts that occur. We deeply characterize the problem showing that not only exact solutions are unfeasible, but also approximated solutions are prohibitive to be adopted in an on-line setting. Therefore we devise a set of heuristics and we compare them trough an extensive simulation based on the real-world Yahoo! Meme social graph, and with parameters learnt from real logs of meme propagations. Our experimentation demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of these methods.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine the role of code (software) in the spatial formation of collective life. Taking the view that human life and coded technology are folded into one another, we theorise space as ontogenesis. Space, we posit, is constantly being bought into being through a process of transduction – the constant making anew of a domain in reiterative and transformative practices - as an incomplete solution to a relational problem. The relational problem we examine is the ongoing encounter between individuals and environment where the solution, to a greater or lesser extent, is code. Code, we posit, is diversely embedded in collectives as coded objects, coded infrastructure, coded processes and coded assemblages. These objects, infrastructure, processes and assemblages possess technicity, that is, unfolding or evolutive power to make things happen; the ability to mediate, supplement, augment, monitor, regulate, operate, facilitate, produce collective life. We contend that when the technicity of code is operationalised it transduces one of three forms of hybrid spatial formations: code/space, coded space and backgrounded coded space. These formations are contingent, relational, extensible and scaleless, often stretched out across networks of greater or shorter length. We demonstrate the coded transduction of space through three vignettes – each a day in the life of three people living in London, UK, tracing the technical mediation of their interactions, transactions and mobilities. We then discuss how code becomes the relational solution to five different classes of problems – domestic living, travelling, working, communicating, and consuming.},

For instance, a sports event broadcasted on TV, or a viral meme introduced by a community of users. Detecting the type of origin can facilitate information filtering, enhance real-time data processing, and improve user experience. In this paper, we introduce a typology to categorize the triggers that leverage trending topics: news, current events, memes, and commemoratives. We define a set of straightforward language-independent features that rely on the social spread of the trends to discriminate among those types of trending topics. Our method provides an efficient way to immediately and accurately categorize trending topics without need of external data, outperforming a content-based approach.},

In our analysis, we (i) examine the impact of loca- tion, time, and distance on the adoption of hashtags, which is important for understanding meme diffusion and infor- mation propagation; (ii) examine the spatial propagation of hashtags through their focus, entropy, and spread; and (iii) present two methods that leverage the spatio-temporal propagation of hashtags to characterize locations. Based on this study, we find that although hashtags are a global phe- nomenon, the physical distance between locations is a strong constraint on the adoption of hashtags, both in terms of the hashtags shared between locations and in the timing of when these hashtags are adopted. We find both spatial and tem- poral locality as most hashtags spread over small geograph- ical areas but at high speeds. We also find that hashtags are mostly a local phenomenon with long-tailed life spans. These (and other) findings have important implications for a variety of systems and applications, including targeted ad- vertising, location-based services, social media search, and content delivery networks.},

@phdthesis{Nye2011,
abstract = {Overview The purpose of this doctoral research is to apply a systems approach to defining and understanding memes. A meme is a piece of social information which transmits and replicates within a society (Heylighen, 1998). Memetics allow insight into the evolution of ideas and behavior, a fundamental ques- tion pertinent to all fields of social science. Three mecha- nisms guide the evolution of memes: reproduction, variation, and selection (Dennett, 1995). These mechanisms have to be understood in terms of empirical research on individual, social, and environmental factors that influence transmission and change of ideas. However, the body of relevant empir- ical study and theory is vast. This raises the basic research question: What synthesis of theories usefully explains meme behavior? The thesis of this research addresses this question using a three step process: 1. Synthesis of Theories - A conceptual model is synthesized which connects social science research to the mechanisms guiding meme transmission and evolution. 2. Computational Model - A cognitive agent simulation model is coded which operationalizes insights and theory captured by the conceptual model. 3. Testing the Model - Experiments conducted using the model examine the validity, flexibility, and types of insight the computational model provides.},

These I label the perspective of substitution and transcendence (dominated by technological Utopianists), the co-evolution perspective (drawing from political economy and cultural studies) and the recombination perspective (derived from recent work in actor-network theory). The discussion turns to each in turn, extracting the geographical dimensions and implications of each.

abstract = {Our goal in this paper is to develop a practical framework for obtaining a uniform sample of users in an online social network (OSN) by crawling its social graph. Such a sample allows to estimate any user property and some topological properties as well. To this end, ﬁrst, we consider and compare several candidate crawling techniques. Two approaches that can produce approximately uniform samples are the MetropolisHasting random walk (MHRW) and a re-weighted random walk (RWRW). Both have pros and cons, which we demonstrate through a comparison to each other as well as to the “ground truth.” In contrast, using Breadth-First-Search (BFS) or an unadjusted Random Walk (RW) leads to substantially biased results. Second, and in addition to ofﬂine performance assessment, we introduce online formal convergence diagnostics to assess sample quality during the data collection process. We show how these diagnostics can be used to effectively determine when a random walk sample is of adequate size and quality. Third, as a case study, we apply the above methods to Facebook and we collect the ﬁrst, to the best of our knowledge, representative sample of Facebook users. We make it publicly available and employ it to characterize several key properties of Facebook.},

@article{Conover2013,
abstract = {Social movements rely in large measure on networked communication technologies to organize and disseminate information relating to the movements' objectives. In this work we seek to understand how the goals and needs of a protest movement are reflected in the geographic patterns of its communication network, and how these patterns differ from those of stable political communication. To this end, we examine an online communication network reconstructed from over 600,000 tweets from a thirty-six week period covering the birth and maturation of the American anticapitalist movement, Occupy Wall Street. We find that, compared to a network of stable domestic political communication, the Occupy Wall Street network exhibits higher levels of locality and a hub and spoke structure, in which the majority of non-local attention is allocated to high-profile locations such as New York, California, and Washington D.C. Moreover, we observe that information flows across state boundaries are more likely to contain framing language and references to the media, while communication among individuals in the same state is more likely to reference protest action and specific places and times. Tying these results to social movement theory, we propose that these features reflect the movement's efforts to mobilize resources at the local level and to develop narrative frames that reinforce collective purpose at the national level.},

abstract = {Sina Weibo, which was launched in 2009, is the most popular Chinese micro-blogging service. It has been reported that Sina Weibo has more than 400 million registered users by the end of the third quarter in 2012. Sina Weibo and Twitter have a lot in common, however, in terms of the following preference, Sina Weibo users, most of whom are Chinese, behave differently compared with those of Twitter. This work is based on a data set of Sina Weibo which contains 80.8 million users' profiles and 7.2 billion relations and a large data set of Twitter. Firstly some basic features of Sina Weibo and Twitter are analyzed such as degree and activeness distribution, correlation between degree and activeness, and the degree of separation. Then the following preference is investigated by studying the assortative mixing, friend similarities, following distribution, edge balance ratio, and ranking correlation, where edge balance ratio is newly proposed to measure balance property of graphs. It is found that Sina Weibo has a lower reciprocity rate, more positive balanced relations and is more disassortative. Coinciding with Asian traditional culture, the following preference of Sina Weibo users is more concentrated and hierarchical: they are more likely to follow people at higher or the same social levels and less likely to follow people lower than themselves. In contrast, the same kind of following preference is weaker in Twitter. Twitter users are open as they follow people from levels, which accords with its global characteristic and the prevalence of western civilization. The message forwarding behavior is studied by displaying the propagation levels, delays, and critical users. The following preference derives from not only the usage habits but also underlying reasons such as personalities and social moralities that is worthy of future research.},

How can we understand this digital milieu and make sense of these data, not only focusing on their functionalities but also reflecting on our everyday life and existence? How do these material constructions demand a new philosophical understand- ing? Instead of following the reductionist approaches, which understand the digital milieu as abstract entities such as information and data, this article pro- poses to approach it from an embodied perspective: objects. The article contrasts digital objects with natural objects (e.g., apples on the table) and technical objects (e.g., hammers) in phenomenological investigations, and proposes to approach digital objects from the concept of relations, on the one hand the material relations that are concretized in the development of mark-up languages, such as SGML, HTML, and XML, and on the other hand, Web ontologies, the temporal relations that are produced and conditioned by the artificial memories of data.},

While much work has looked at efforts to prevent access to information in China (including IP blocking of foreign Web sites or search engine filtering), we present here the first large\&ndash;scale analysis of political content censorship in social media, i.e. , the active deletion of messages published by individuals. In a statistical analysis of 56 million messages (212,583 of which have been deleted out of 1.3 million checked, more than 16 percent) from the domestic Chinese microblog site Sina Weibo, and 11 million Chinese\&ndash;language messages from Twitter, we uncover a set a politically sensitive terms whose presence in a message leads to anomalously higher rates of deletion. We also note that the rate of message deletion is not uniform throughout the country, with messages originating in the outlying provinces of Tibet and Qinghai exhibiting much higher deletion rates than those from eastern areas like Beijing.},

@book{Dawkins1989,
abstract = {Richard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it. His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life. In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature. Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk. This revised edition of Dawkins' fascinating book contains two new chapters. One, entitled "Nice Guys Finish First," demonstrates how cooperation can evolve even in a basically selfish world. The other new chapter, entitled "The Long Reach of the Gene," which reflects the arguments presented in Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, clarifies the startling view that genes may reach outside the bodies in which they dwell and manipulate other individuals and even the world at large. Containing a wealth of remarkable new insights into the biological world, the second edition once again drives home the fact that truth is stranger than fiction.},
